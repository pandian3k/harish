RDSEssentials:
RDS is a fully managed Relational Database service:
* It is fully-managed: it does not allow access to the underlying operating system.
* Connections to the RDS database server look the same as connecting to a traditional on-premise database instance.
* You can enabe Multi-AZ deployments for backu and high available solutions.
* Utilize Read Replicas (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Aurora) to help offload hits on your primary database.

	Aurora : MySQL or postgresSQL compatible. and it has 5 times better performance then MySQL and lower price point than commercial database.5Xfaster than MySQL and 3Xfaster than postgresSQL. Continuous backup upt to 15 read replicas across 3 AZs.
	replication lag of a single-digit milliseconds. Baacktrack in Seconds. Multi-Master option.

	Benefits: Automatic minor updates , Automatic backups (point-in-time snapshots), server/platform managed by AWS (pass), Multi-AZ-with single click and Automatic recovery in event of a failover. Auto scaling. No management of instances or clusters. Scales to Zero.
	
	RDS Multi-AZ-Failover:
	Multi-AZ failoversynchronously
